Service Tracking App for Matthews Plumbing

## Synopsis
This is a rough collection of ideas for things we need to track for our service clients, who are commercial office locations. Need to design an application and framework for tracking on site issues and then making sure everyone who needs to know about the relevant information receives that information. The framework would include labeling all potential plumbing items and coming up with a standardized way of labeling items on site so that technicians will not need to be shown the issue. The wiki will continue to grow as ideas are fleshed out.
